/* NOTES ON LAUNCHBOX AND 7-ZIP
 * 
 * When an emulator has the "Extract ROM archives before running option"
 * checked and a game is launched, 7z is called twice. The first call extracts
 * the archive with the command:
 * 
 *     7z.exe x <rom path> -o<output path> -y -aoa -bsp1
 * 
 * where <rom path> and <output path> are absolute, and <output path> is a temp
 * location of LaunchBox\ThirdParty\7-Zip\Temp
 * 
 * Once extraction completes and 7z returns, LaunchBox will call 7z a second
 * time to list the archive content with the command:
 * 
 *     7z.exe l <rom path> -slt
 * 
 * LaunchBox uses this file list to determine which rom path to supply to the
 * emulator. It also uses this list to determine which files to delete from the
 * temp location when the emulator exits.
 * 
 * LaunchBox also uses 7z to perform other functions, namely extracting
 * downloaded metadata.xml, and performing data backups.
